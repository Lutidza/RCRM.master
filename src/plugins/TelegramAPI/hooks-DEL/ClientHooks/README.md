# bannedClientHook Documentation

## Integration in the Plugin
For a modular design, this hook is placed in its own file (`src/plugins/TelegramAPI/hooks/ClientHooks/bannedClientHook.ts`) and is imported in your main plugin file (`src/plugins/TelegramAPI/index.ts`). This way, you remove the inline banned-checking code and maintain the rest of your functionality unchanged.

## Logging
The hook logs the clientâ€™s ID, status alias, and banned status to the console for debugging purposes. Make sure your logging setup captures these details in production if necessary.

## Conclusion
The `bannedClientHook` is a robust solution for preventing banned clients from interacting with your Telegram bot. By integrating it as a custom hook within your bot's update pipeline, you ensure that any client with a banned status is promptly notified and their session cleared, thereby stopping further interactions.

This documentation provides all the necessary details for understanding, using, and integrating the `bannedClientHook` into your project.

## Implementation Overview
### Core Functionality
- Retrieves the client from the `clients` collection using `telegram_id`.
- Checks the status field (alias or via query to the `statuses` collection).
- If the alias is `banned`, sends a notification to the user, clears their session, and halts further processing.

### Usage
1. Place the hook in `src/plugins/TelegramAPI/hooks/ClientHooks/bannedClientHook.ts`.
2. Import it in `src/plugins/TelegramAPI/index.ts`.
3. Add it to the bot's update pipeline.

### Key Takeaways
- **Modular Design:** Placed in a dedicated file and imported into the plugin.
- **Logging for Debugging:** Captures important information about banned users.
- **Prevents Interactions:** Stops banned users from further engaging with the bot.
- **Session Clearance:** Clears user session to ensure they are fully blocked.

## Next Steps & Potential Enhancements
- Add a configurable cooldown or warning system before banning.
- Implement additional logging and monitoring to track banned interactions.
- Expand with admin notifications upon banning a user.
